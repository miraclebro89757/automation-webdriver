Good morning! My name is Lucas. I graduated from China Jiliang University with a degree in Measurement and Control Technology, and I have 7 years of experience as a Software Test Engineer.
In my previous roles, I have led testing projects and helped improve the efficiency and quality of software releases. For example, I introduced automated testing solutions that significantly reduced testing time and improved product quality.
I am a responsible and proactive team player, always eager to learn new things and adapt to new challenges. I enjoy working with others to achieve common goals and believe that good communication is key to success.

**3. What are your strengths and weaknesses?**  
你的优点和缺点是什么？
- 答题思路：优点突出细致、责任心、沟通能力，缺点可说“过于追求细节、正在提升自动化技能”等。
Strengths:
One of my main strengths is my strong self-motivation and willingness to learn new things. For example, when I started as a manual tester, I found the work repetitive, so I taught myself API automation. This allowed me to automate about 80% of our test cases, which greatly improved our testing efficiency and helped me grow from a manual tester to an automation tester. I am also detail-oriented and responsible, and I communicate well with my team.
Weaknesses:
Sometimes, I can get too focused on technical details, which may distract me from the bigger picture. To address this, I now make a note of interesting technical topics and only explore them after I finish my main tasks. This helps me stay focused and manage my time better.

end:
Think you for make some time to see me .
