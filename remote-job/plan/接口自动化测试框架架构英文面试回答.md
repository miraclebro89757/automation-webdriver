# 接口自动化测试框架架构——英文面试高分回答（中英文对照）

---

## Q: Can you explain the architecture of an interface automation test framework?

**Oral, Fluent English Answer:**

Sure! The core architecture of my interface automation test framework can be broken down into three main parts:

**The first part is test case management.** We use Excel to manage and organize all our test cases. This makes it really easy for everyone on the team to add or update cases, even if they don’t have a strong technical background.

**The second part is format validation.** We convert those Excel cases into YAML files. This step helps us check the structure and make sure everything is clear and well-organized. YAML is easy to read and lets us handle things like dependencies, assertions, and test data in a very flexible way.

**The last part is test execution.** We take the validated YAML files and turn them into Python scripts, which are then run by pytest. Pytest is our main engine for running the tests. It supports all kinds of assertions, handles dependencies between tests, and is easy to extend for more complex business needs.

**So, to sum up:**
- First, testers write and manage cases in Excel.
- Second, the framework converts Excel to YAML for structure checking.
- Last, YAML is turned into Python code and executed by pytest.
- After running, we get detailed HTML reports and logs, which help us quickly analyze results and troubleshoot any issues.

**Key features:**
- Supports complex assertions and test dependencies.
- Easy to extend for custom business needs.
- Makes teamwork easy by separating case design from code implementation.

## 中文参考表达

当然可以！我设计过一个既适合团队协作又具备可扩展性的接口自动化测试框架，核心架构分为三层：

1. **用例管理（Excel）：**  
   测试人员在Excel中维护用例，便于非技术成员协作和更新。

2. **中间校验（YAML）：**  
   框架将Excel用例转为YAML格式，进行结构校验和配置管理。YAML结构清晰，便于管理依赖、断言和测试数据。

3. **执行引擎（pytest）：**  
   校验后的YAML会被转为Python测试脚本，由pytest执行。pytest作为核心执行引擎，支持丰富的断言、依赖和扩展能力，适合复杂业务场景。

**主要流程：**
- 测试人员用Excel编写和维护用例  
- 框架自动将Excel转为YAML进行校验  
- YAML再转为Python代码并执行  
- 执行后生成详细的HTML报告和日志，便于分析和排查问题

**主要特点：**
- 支持复杂断言和用例依赖  
- 高度可扩展，适应定制化业务需求  
- 用例设计与代码实现分离，便于团队协作
